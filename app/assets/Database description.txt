For this project our Database will be pulling from 3 Sources from a One Piece API: https://api-onepiece.com/

These three sources are
- The Characters: https://api-onepiece.com/documentation/13-character
- The Crews: https://api-onepiece.com/documentation/12-crew
- The Fruits: https://api-onepiece.com/documentation/2-fruit

Our data will be structured into 3 tables that correspond to the API Endpoints we chose. These tables will be named Characters,
Crews, and Fruits.

The Characters table will contain the following columns:
- Id [PK]
- name
- job
- age
- size
- bounty
- status
- crew_id [FK]

The Crews table will contain the following columns:
- id [PK]
- name
- roman_name
- total_bounty
- number_of_members
- status

The Fruits table will contain the following columns:
- id [PK]
- name
- roman_name
- fruit_type
- description
- character_id [FK]

In terms of table relation we can start first with the Crews Table. This table is needed as it will connected to the Characters
table via Foreign Key (crew_id) so that users can see which Crew a Character is under. The Fruits table is needed as it provides
information on the Fruits that provide our characters their abilities/superpowers. We can see which Fruit belongs to which
character via Foreign Key (character_id). The Characters table is needed as both the Crews and Fruits tables are connected to it.
It is also the table with the most info and the highlight of the website.
