1,Gum-Gum Fruit,Gomu Gomu no Mi,Paramecia,"Gomu Gomu no Mi, also known as the Gum-Gum Fruit in French, is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gives the user's body the same properties as rubber, making the eater an Elastic Man (ゴム人間, Gomu Ningen). This was once a treasure that Shanks and his crew took from a World Government convoy, protected by CP9, but was accidentally eaten by Monkey D. Luffy"
2,Fruit of Fragmentation,Bara Bara no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to separate your body into several parts and levitate them. Parts can fly in a sector 200 meters in diameter around the feet. The latter, for their part, cannot levitate (they can, however, walk). This power makes the user immune to sharp weapons. Any part of the user will still be sensitive to the pain experienced by other detached parts of the body."
3,Fruit Slide-Slide,Sube Sube no Mi,Paramecia,"Smoothes the user's skin and, therefore, makes it more beautiful. In addition, his skin becomes ultra-slippery and therefore deflects objects touching his body."
4,Kilo-Kilo Fruit,Kilo Kilo no Mi,Paramecia,Allows you to vary the user's weight between a featherweight and 10 tonnes. It should be noted that the user does not change volume when he changes his mass.

7,Ciro-Fruit,Doru Doru no Mi,Paramecia,Produces a wax that hardens quickly and can be molded into any shape. This wax becomes very strong when hardened but still remains as vulnerable to heat as normal wax. It should be noted that it can block most poisons.
8,Glutton Fruit,Baku Baku no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to eat anything and integrate those foods into their own body. For example, if he eats a cannon, his tongue can turn into a real cannon. He can also fuse beings he has eaten and self-ingest in order to lose weight."
9,Tranny-Fruit,Mane Mane no Mi,Paramecia,Allows you to change your appearance by touching your face with your right hand and return to your normal appearance by touching your face with your left hand. It is enough to touch a person once for their appearance to be remembered forever. Its user can also make parts of different people but he is unable to attack if he does not have his face and his own body.
10,Sea urchin fruit,Toga Toga no Mi,Paramecia,Allows you to transform all parts of your body (even your hair) into spikes that are strong enough to pierce stone walls. These spikes are also useful for performing acupuncture techniques which are used to increase the muscle mass of the user.
11,Slashing Fruit,Supa Supa no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to transform parts of your body into sharp steel. Its possessor can, for example, transform its body into sharp blades so that it protects it or its arms so that they become sharp blades."

14,Fruit of the Thread,Ito Ito no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to take control of someone and use them as a puppet as well as easily cut out people and objects of various sizes within a large area. It also allows its user to cling to clouds to 'fly', to connect several wires together to create a sharp whip and in a 'combined' version in the form of a ball to 'pull' balls of wire in the manner of 'a pistol shot. And finally, he can create a clone from strings which has the same abilities as its owner and this clone is impervious to bladed weapons. Thanks to its fruit, its user can administer first aid by stitching up his organs and open wounds."
15,Soft Fruit,Noro Noro no Mi,Paramecia,Allows you to emit a ray that slows the movement of any mass for 30 seconds. This ray can be reflected using a mirror and its user is not immune to the effects of its rays.
16,Porter's Fruit,Doa Doa no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to transform anything they touch into a door: whether it is a wall, part of a human body or the void. In the latter case, the user 'disappears' into another dimension and can go anywhere they want by opening a door at a specific location."
17,Bubble Fruit,Awa Awa no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its possessor to produce soap bubbles that clean everything until removing the force itself. Also allows you to soap the skin and make the enemy so slippery that he can hardly move or hold anything in his hands.
18,Berry Fruit,Beri Beri no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to divide their body into parts that resemble berries and therefore bounce on all surfaces. He is therefore immune to punches and blunt weapons.

20,Fruit of the Wheels,Shari Shari no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its owner to transform parts of its body into wheels and spin them at high speeds.
21,Fruit of the Resurrection,Yomi Yomi no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows the owner to come back to life once dead (this power only works once). Its possessor can bring his soul out of his body to pass through walls and return it to his body as he wishes. Likewise, if his head is cut off, his fruit allows him to bring it back on his shoulders by the sole force of his will (the soul is always connected to his body). If his power is combined with a sword, he can harm by freezing any enemy he touches thanks to the icy cold of the depths that his soul brings to his sword."
22,Shadow Fruit,Kage Kage no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to control shadows. He can cut anyone's shadows using a pair of scissors and the removed shadows can be sealed into inert bodies, giving rise to zombies with the fighting skills of the person being the shadow belonged. If shadows are locked in the body of a living being, they can only stay for a short time, depending on the mental strength of the living being. For example, its user has consumed up to 1000. It should also be noted that its user can use their own shadow and make it tangible. He can therefore use his shadow to teleport or protect himself from physical attacks."
23,Fruit of Ectoplasm,Horo Horo no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to create ghosts with various abilities such as sap morale or explode. It also allows its user to become intangible: its user can therefore float in the air and pass through walls but has the big disadvantage of leaving his body inert and defenseless.

27,Fruit of the Scalpel,Ope Ope no Mi,Paramecia,"This fruit allows whoever eats it to create a sphere in which they can do everything from interchanging something with another or extending the range of their saber blows. It can also cut up its victims without killing them or negate the gravity of anything in the sphere. Its user can even go so far as to remove a person's heart leaving them alive or swap the personalities of several people. This fruit is considered the ""ultimate devil fruit"" due to its unique ability to grant another person eternal youth in exchange for the user's life."
28,Fruit of the Castle,Shiro Shiro no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to become a castle man whose few particularities are as follows: any person who is within a certain range of him (delimited by a red zone) is miniaturized and the one who leaves returns to his normal size, the holder can create loopholes in his body to allow the besieged to “defend the fortress”. The user's interior is made up of different rooms where members can live there. The user can also miniaturize himself to join his guests but this leaves his physical body inert. He can replace his legs with a system of caterpillars in order to move more easily or transform into a sort of fortified armed golem that can serve as a refuge for his allies."
29,Straw Fruit,Wara Wara no Mi,Paramecia,Allows the user to produce and handle the straw as they wish. He can also use straw to redirect damage.

When the user reverses the process, the victim has no memory of the time spent while petrified."
32,Poison Fruit,Doku Doku no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to secrete a variety of poisons and toxic gases. The effects of these venoms change depending on the user's needs. The latter can give any shape to his creations and he can also cover his entire body with poison to protect himself.
33,Fruit of Hormones,Horu Horu no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to secrete hormones and inject them into themselves or someone else. These hormones can modify the body of the person into whom they have been injected: for example, we can modify their sex. These hormones can also heal, revitalize (adrenaline) or enlarge a part of the body."
34,Scissors Fruit,Choki Choki no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows the user to transform their hands into scissors that cut absolutely anything, from sheets of paper to brick walls. Any cut material can be handled very easily."
35,Fruit of Tremor,Gura Gura no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to create seismic waves to cause earthquakes or cracks (even in the ambient air) which destroy everything in their areas of effect. The strength of these waves varies according to the user's desire and these waves can be disproportionately large. The power of this fruit is so powerful that it can also cause tsunamis or abysses. Seismic waves can cover weapons to increase the power of their blows.
36,Sparkling Fruit,Kira Kira no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to transform their body into a diamond. It then has extraordinary resistance.

40,Fruit of the In-the-Mile,Mato Mato no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to aim at a “target” at any time and in any place with any object, whether animated or not. Its user is limited to one target per hand by simply touching it: these are memorized until he decides to touch another."

44,Bad luck fruit,Beta Beta no Mi,Paramecia,"the body of whoever eats it can generate mucus at will. This mucus has the following characteristics: sticky, adherent and flammable. It can therefore use its mucus to grab onto objects, stick to all surfaces or even inflame it."
45,Toy Fruit,Hobi Hobi no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to turn any person into a toy by simply touching them. Transformed people no longer have control of their bodies and obey orders given to them (at least, if the user gave them any). The effects of this fruit stop its user's growth the moment they eat it. People transformed into toys fall into oblivion, all memories linked to them disappear and they are preserved from aging. If the user falls unconscious, all people become themselves again and the memories of the people who had forgotten them resurface."

48,Fruit of Couture,Nui Nui no Mi,Paramecia,Allows the user to sew and unsew everything on flat surfaces. These seams are strong enough to keep people 'hanging' to the ground.
49,Fruit of the Gaze,Giro Giro no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to read people's minds, transmit their own memories to someone else as well as generate tears of various shapes (e.g. whale-shaped tears with enough power to pulverize wooden boxes and knock out a group of people). It also allows its user to observe events that take place far from him by “transmuting” his gaze into a bird's eye to observe from the skies everything that is happening within a given perimeter."
50,Fruit of Art,Ato Ato no Mi,Paramecia,Allows its user to create a mist that transforms everything it touches into a work of art. Any being or object transformed into a work of art loses its original functionality.

59,Fruit of Healing,Chiyu Chiyu no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to temporarily heal any living being through its user's cries. He can permanently heal the injured by taking a little vital energy from healthy people (this energy takes the form of a dandelion flower). By extension, its user can repair any object but at the expense of its life expectancy."
60,Soul Fruit,Soru Soru no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows you to manipulate the souls of human beings to the user's wishes. The latter can introduce a soul into an object or an animal to make it alive in order to humanize it, that is to say, to give them consciousness and the gift of speech. These beings are called 'Homies'. The user can also divide their own soul into fragments which live as an avatar of the fruit eater. The main role of these avatars is to collect fragments of the lives of living beings in order to redistribute them to their owner. People who have no fear of dying or possess psychic power are more resistant to this fruit."
61,Mirror Fruit,Mira Mira no Mi,Paramecia,"Allows its user to be able to repeat the gestures of their opponents and to reflect their attacks. It is also possible to mirror people onto animals. Living beings can be captured in mirrors and find themselves in a world where mirrors are only the access points to this world.

63,Cookie Fruit,Bisu Bisu no Mi,Paramecia,Allows the user to produce and handle cookies as desired. Its user can cover himself with cookies in order to create an alter-ego different from himself and create a multitude of copies of this same alter-ego.

When some people become amnesiac, its user can make them temporarily recover their memories."
